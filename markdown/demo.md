description: 'A demo app based on OpenResty and adg-openresty dynamically generating a piston drawing from a set of custom data'
---
Here you can modify any data and generate your own piston drawing in PNG, SVG
or PDF format. There are no limits, but entering nonsense values (e.g. setting
**Length** to 0) "degenerates" the drawing and the output will be meaningless.
To reset the form to its original state, just refresh the page.

The endpoint generating the drawing is a sample installation of the
[adg-openresty](https://github.com/ntd/adg-openresty) project.
